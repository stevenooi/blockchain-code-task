## Purpose of Program
This project is built for Coding Challenge for Blockchain Global. The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
There are no other obstructions on the table surface.. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.The application receives input in form PLACE, MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT, REPORT. The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement.
